Branches
--------
* `cran` - will contain the version currently available on
  [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)
* `dev` - will have the most recent development release
* other branches will exist as needed

Wish list
---------
* make it easy to get uncertainty intervals for the IV checks
* for network survival, make it easy to use the two alternate estimators which
  are appropriate when additional information about population distribution is
  available (see Rwanda mortality paper)
